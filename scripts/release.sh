# release.sh — create a GitHub Release for the version in pyproject.toml, which
# triggers the workflow to build the sdist + wheel AND publish to PyPI.
#
# This DOES publish (irreversibly for that version number). It refuses to run
# unless:
#   * the version in pyproject.toml is strictly newer than the latest release/tag
#     already on GitHub, and
#   * the tag vX.Y.Z does not already exist on the remote, and
#   * your local main matches origin/main (so the release matches what you tested).
# Then it asks you to type the tag to confirm before creating the release.
#
# Usage:  scripts/release.sh
# Needs:  gh CLI, authenticated (`gh auth login`) with repo + workflow scope.

set -euo pipefail
# If the script dies on an unhandled command failure, say exactly where.
